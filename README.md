# UNBN Toolkit
### *A Framework for Coherent Systems*  
*(in the spirit of David Bohm)*

Most scientific tools begin with parts: particles, fields, agents, markets, equations.  
The Unified Node Box Network (UNBN) begins somewhere else — with **relationships**.

In this toolkit, a system is not defined by what it is made of, but by **how it holds together**.  
Coherence is the primary object. Everything else follows from it.

UNBN provides a simple architecture — eight functional “nodes” — that describe how any system maintains, transforms, and expresses its coherence:

1. **State** — what exists at a moment  
2. **Flow** — how it changes  
3. **Constraint** — what must remain consistent  
4. **Interaction** — how parts influence one another  
5. **Symmetry** — what stays the same through change  
6. **Geometry** — how the system is arranged  
7. **Measurement** — how coherence becomes visible  
8. **Reconfiguration** — how the system adapts

These nodes are not separate modules.  
They are **aspects of a single unfolding process**, much like Bohm’s implicate order:  
a deeper structure that gives rise to the patterns we observe.

UNBN is a toolkit for exploring that unfolding.

## Why UNBN?

Modern science often divides itself into isolated domains:

- classical mechanics  
- quantum many‑body physics  
- gauge theory  
- economics  
- networks  
- information systems  

Each domain develops its own language, its own tools, its own assumptions.

UNBN offers a different approach.

It provides a **common architecture** that applies across all of them —  
not by forcing them into the same equations, but by revealing the same **structural grammar** beneath them.

A classical N‑body system, an SU(3) spin chain, a lattice gauge field, and a supply‑chain economy all share:

- flows  
- constraints  
- symmetries  
- interactions  
- geometry  
- adaptation  

UNBN makes these parallels explicit and computationally usable.

## What This Toolkit Provides

The UNBN Toolkit is a **playground for coherent systems**.  
It includes:

### • A minimal core architecture
Abstract classes for the eight nodes, and a simple simulation loop that ties them together.

### • Physics modules
- Classical N‑body  
- SU(N) quantum many‑body  
- Tensor‑network solvers (MPS, MPO, TEBD)  
- Lattice SU(N) gauge theory  
- Gauge‑invariant tensor networks  

### • Economics modules
- Agents  
- Markets  
- Price flows  
- Networked production  
- Budget constraints as Gauss‑law analogues  

### • Integration modules
Cross‑domain systems where physics and economics share the same structural grammar.

### • Examples
Runnable scripts that mirror the chapters of the UNBN monograph.

## How to Use UNBN

UNBN is not a library of fixed models.  
It is a **framework for building your own**.

You begin by choosing the aspects of the system you want to explore:

- What is the state?  
- What flows through it?  
- What must remain consistent?  
- What symmetries shape its evolution?  
- What geometry does it inhabit?  
- How do you observe it?  
- How does it adapt?  

Then you implement those aspects using the eight nodes.

The toolkit handles the rest.

## A Note on Mathematics

UNBN does not require advanced mathematics to begin.  
The architecture is conceptual, not algebraic.

Mathematics enters only when you choose to deepen a particular domain:

- SU(N) generators for quantum systems  
- Hamiltonians for gauge fields  
- network flows for economics  

But the core ideas remain accessible:

- coherence  
- transformation  
- constraint  
- symmetry  
- relationship  

These are universal.

# Qualia: The Felt Side of Coherence

Every system has two faces.

One face is structural: flows, constraints, symmetries, interactions.  
This is the side we can model, simulate, and formalize.

The other face is experiential: the way a system *feels* from within.  
This is the domain of **qualia**.

UNBN does not attempt to reduce qualia to equations or mechanisms.  
Instead, it treats qualia as the **inner aspect of coherence** —  
the lived expression of the same processes that, from the outside, appear as dynamics and structure.

In Bohm’s language, qualia belong to the **implicate order**:  
the enfolded, immediate presence of the whole within each part.

From this perspective:

- A quantum state has a “shape of possibility.”  
- A classical system has a “texture of motion.”  
- A gauge field has a “tension of constraint.”  
- An economic network has a “mood of flow and scarcity.”  
- A mind has a “field of experience.”  

These are not metaphors.  
They are different expressions of the same underlying coherence.

UNBN does not claim to explain consciousness.  
But it does offer a way to **speak about systems in which the structural and experiential aspects are two sides of one unfolding process**.

Qualia, in this view, are not added on top of a system.  
They are the **interior resonance** of the system’s coherence.

When a system reorganizes — when it undergoes a “time storm” —  
its qualia shift as well.  
The felt sense of the system changes because the coherence that sustains it has changed.

UNBN provides tools for modeling the structural side of this process.  
The experiential side remains open, but not separate.  
It is the silent partner of every simulation, every flow, every constraint.

In this sense, qualia are not an anomaly.  
They are a reminder that every coherent system has an inside.

## Who This Toolkit Is For

- physicists exploring many‑body or gauge systems  
- economists studying flows and constraints  
- complexity researchers  
- network theorists  
- simulation architects  
- anyone curious about coherence across domains  

If you can describe a system in terms of flows, constraints, and relationships, you can model it with UNBN.

## The Book

The UNBN monograph is generated from this toolkit.  
Each chapter corresponds to a module or example in the repository.

The book is not separate from the code.  
It is the **reflection** of the code — the explicate order emerging from the implicate architecture.

---

## A Final Thought

UNBN is not a theory of everything.  
It is a **framework for seeing everything as coherent**.

In Bohm’s language:

> *“The whole is in the parts, and the parts are in the whole.”*

This toolkit is an invitation to explore that idea —  
not as philosophy, but as working code.
