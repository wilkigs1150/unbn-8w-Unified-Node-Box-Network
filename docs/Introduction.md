\section{Introduction} The Unified Node–Box Network (UNBN) framework provides a structural language for describing systems whose behavior arises from the interactions of simple, modular units. Each unit---a \emph{node box}---is defined not only by its internal state but by the pattern of relations that guide how it receives, transforms, and emits information. UNBN is designed to be domain–agnostic. The same formalism can describe classical dynamical systems, quantum processes, economic flows, coherence structures, and speculative physical regimes. The framework is minimal by construction: it introduces only the structures required to express generative behavior, coherence transitions, and adaptive organization. At its core, UNBN replaces the traditional emphasis on objects and equations with an emphasis on \emph{relations and coherence}. A system is understood not as a fixed set of entities but as a continuously evolving network of node boxes whose interactions determine the global state. Coherence functionals, compass structures, and generative update rules provide the mathematical backbone for this evolution. A node box carries a state $x_i$ drawn from a domain–appropriate space $\mathcal{X}$ and is equipped with a \emph{compass} $$C_i = (I_i, O_i, S_i, E_i),
