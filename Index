# UNBN Documentation  
*A Framework for Coherent Systems*

This documentation mirrors the structure of the UNBN Toolkit.  
Each chapter corresponds to a module or example in the codebase.

UNBN begins not with equations or domain‑specific assumptions,  
but with a simple architectural insight:

**Coherence has a structure.**

The eight nodes of the UNBN architecture — State, Flow, Constraint, Interaction,  
Symmetry, Geometry, Measurement, Reconfiguration — provide a universal grammar  
for describing how systems hold together, transform, and adapt.

This documentation unfolds that grammar across several domains:

- classical mechanics  
- quantum many‑body systems  
- lattice gauge theory  
- economic networks  
- cross‑domain integration  

Each chapter is intentionally gentle.  
The mathematics is optional.  
The architecture is primary.

UNBN is not a theory of everything.  
It is a framework for seeing everything as coherent.
