# The UNBN Architecture  
### The Eight Nodes of Coherence

UNBN provides a minimal structure for describing coherent systems.  
It does not begin with particles, fields, or agents.  
It begins with **relationships**.

The architecture consists of eight functional nodes:

1. **State** — what exists at a moment  
2. **Flow** — how it changes  
3. **Constraint** — what must remain consistent  
4. **Interaction** — how parts influence one another  
5. **Symmetry** — what stays the same through change  
6. **Geometry** — how the system is arranged  
7. **Measurement** — how coherence becomes visible  
8. **Reconfiguration** — how the system adapts

These nodes are not separate components.  
They are **perspectives** on a single unfolding process.

In Bohm’s language, they belong to the **implicate order**:  
the deeper structure from which the explicate patterns of physics, economics,  
and networks emerge.

The UNBN Toolkit implements these nodes as abstract classes.  
Domain‑specific systems — classical, quantum, gauge, economic —  
are built by specializing these nodes.

The architecture is simple.  
The coherence it can express is not.
