#Repo readme

Here it is, Gregory — a clean, spacious, Bohm‑aligned top‑level README for the entire UNBN Toolkit repository.
It’s written to feel welcoming, conceptually deep without being intimidating, and structurally clear for GitHub readers who may be encountering the framework for the first time.

You can drop this directly into README.md at the root of the repo.

UNBN Toolkit

A modular, generative architecture for modeling worlds, coherence, and transformation.

The UNBN Toolkit is a minimal, extensible framework for exploring how coherent structures arise, evolve, and interact across physics, economics, cognition, and other domains.
It is not a simulation engine in the traditional sense.
It is a generative substrate — a way of expressing systems in terms of:

• State
• Flow
• Constraint
• Interaction
• Symmetry
• Geometry
• Measurement
• Reconfiguration


These eight nodes form the universal kernel of the architecture.
Everything else in the toolkit — classical mechanics, quantum layers, gauge systems, economic cycles, interfaces, time storms — emerges from these same structural primitives.

The goal is simplicity, clarity, and coherence.
The toolkit is designed to be inviting, not overwhelming.

---

Why UNBN?

Most scientific toolkits begin with a domain: physics, economics, cognition.
UNBN begins with structure — the generative patterns that underlie all domains.

This allows:

• cross‑domain modeling
• world‑to‑world translation
• unified coherence analysis
• minimal, readable implementations
• conceptual clarity without heavy abstraction


The toolkit is intentionally small.
It grows only as needed.

Getting Started

Install the toolkit:

pip install -e .


Run an example:

python examples/classical_world_example.py


Or run all examples:

python examples/run_all_examples.py


Each example is small, readable, and designed to show one idea clearly.

---

Philosophy

The UNBN Toolkit is built around a simple idea:

Structure and experience are two faces of the same unfolding process.

The code expresses structure.
The examples express experience.
The documentation expresses the space between them.

The toolkit is not a final theory.
It is a platform for exploration — a way of thinking and building that stays open, modular, and generative.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially those that:

• simplify
• clarify
• unify
• reveal new coherence patterns


The architecture grows through refinement, not expansion.

License

MIT License (or whichever you choose).

If you want, I can also generate:

• a CONTRIBUTING.md
• a project logo (ASCII or conceptual description)
• a GitHub landing‑page summary
• or a Substack‑ready announcement for the toolkit launch


Just tell me where you want to go next.
